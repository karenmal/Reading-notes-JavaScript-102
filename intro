# Intro

I have been a graphic designer for 28 years and was most recently laid off due to COVID. I have been in priinting all of the 28 years. I like designing, but jobs are pretty scarce. I have done a lot of personalized mailings and we had to write very small amounts and very basic code in Java Script. I liked figuring out how to write something to do exactly what you want. This opportunity came up, so I am going for it.
