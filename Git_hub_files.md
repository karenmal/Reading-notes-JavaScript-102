## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

When you continue to learn from your mistakes/setbacks/failures, you are challenging yourself to grow. You are putting in the effort, so you can get the best version of you both professionally and personally.

• Don't let the shiny things distract you. Stay focused.

• Do research if you run into problems . . . ask questions

• Learn from others!
