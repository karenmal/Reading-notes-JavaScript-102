## Revisions and the Cloud
### Version Control:
  * Version control lets you go back to previous versions, you can go back compare changes, track modifications or if your files get corrupt/lost, you can revert back to a previos version. 
  * Files can be cloned to your desktop, edit them, and push them back to the cloud. Saving all of your revisions.
  
### What is GIT:
1. Distributed Version Control system (DVCS) - data file system made up of snapshots. Every time you commit, a snapshot gets saved for you to revert back if needed. Only saves what has been changed. 
2. Mostly relies on local information, most necessary information can be found in local resources. SInce it resides on local disk, doesn't need to get info from a server.
3. Acts like a gatekeeper, keeps track of every single change to any file and/or directory.
4. Files in gate can remain in three main states: commited, modified and staged.
