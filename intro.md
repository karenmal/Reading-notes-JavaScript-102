# Intro

I have been a graphic designer for 28 years and was most recently laid off due to COVID. 
Working at multiple printing companies for the 28 years, part of my job was the personalized mailings and variable data, we had to write very basic code in Java Script. I liked figuring out how to write something to do exactly what you wanted. This opportunity came up to come to DeltaV, so I am going for it.
