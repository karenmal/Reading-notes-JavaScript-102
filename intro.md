# Intro

I have been a graphic designer for 28 years and was most recently laid off due to COVID. 
Working at multiple printing companies for all of the 28 years. I like designing, but the jobs are pretty scarce. 
Personalized mailings and variable data was part of my job and we had to write small amounts and very basic code in Java Script. 
I liked figuring out how to write something to do exactly what you wanted. This opportunity came up to come to DeltaV, so I am going for it.
